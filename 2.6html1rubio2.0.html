	<p>Now, I know what you're probably thinkin'. What the cockdoodle kinda site this?! This may read as either a treasure trove of tickles for your jugular vein<br>or this will look like the scribblings of a madman. Either way it goes this is the bottom line: Unless you got insurance for a new head, good luck tryna find <br> a new one 'cause I'm gonna make your head pop from guffawin'!</p>

	<p2 title="Gee, ain't these lil' attributes a little honey?">The following images show how I go about creating my crazy comics. I'm a traditionalist who likes the feel of the smooth paper and actually measuring<br>out the comic panels with a ruler and penciling in the panels and elements. Then inking it all in! If you think <b>that</b> sounds real complicated try thinkin' of<br>some stupid jokes for these things. Trust me folksies, the writing is the most difficult part!</p2>
